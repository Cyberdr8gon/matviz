## a matrix visualizer

When looking for patterns in data, it is often useful to see representations of the data.
Thus this project was born.

# installing
Currently, this is a early project. We use cmake to build the project. It is a goal of mine to remain cross platform, thus, I will only be depending on the standard libraries if at all possible. You should first open build.sh in the root directory and change
```
PROJECT_ROOT_DIR=/whatever/your/path/to/this/is
```
then you should be able to run:
```
build.sh
```
and it should automate the build process for you.
